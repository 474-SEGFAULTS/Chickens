Team Name: The SegFaults

## Overview:

This game will be similar to the already created “Worms” game. Our game consists of a map in which you are YouDee and are going through rounds of other mascots (enemies) trying to defeat them all with a multitude of weapons. Each round gets tougher with enemies being in harder to reach areas or them having more powerful weapons. Each player (including you) will have a health bar and with each round the health bars will increase. Different weapons do different amounts of damage. Random drops of bonus items can appear in the map, such as an increase in health, speed, etc.

## Implementation:

The project is going to be implemented primarily using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and VBC as suggested in class. We will use HTML to outline the main playing and exit screens (multiplayer). In addition, we will use CSS for the design of the characters and backgrounds. From there we can use Javascript, VBC, and JQuery in order to create functions and methods to create the game’s movements and scoring. Lastly we will use Github to share code easily. We intend on creating multiple methods and functions in order to outline movements, scoring, and the intensity of the playing rounds. Our plan for this game’s controls is to use A-W-S-D keys to move, spacebar to jump, and the cursor to aim and shoot.

## Responsibilities:
 - @jvillemare - working on the networking, WebRTC (Potentially if we can make it multiplayer)
 - @vivatheest - on the art, basic one or two frame animations (gifs), CSS styling
 - @happyaaa - on the 2d rendering (since this is using basic DOM manipulation and vanilla JavaScript)
 - @luckyruby1 -  on the interfaces
 - @wjm - on game logic, inputs, player interaction. and probably also helping all around
